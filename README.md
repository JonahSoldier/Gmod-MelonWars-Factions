# MelonWars:Factions

A modified version of MelonWars:RTS, a sandbox strategy game.

This version includes an overhaul of the factions, new content, polish/QOL and balancing changes.
It also includes a host of technical improvements, including a mountain of bugfixes, optimizations, security improvements, and compatibility for dedicated servers.

The new content and balance changes have been extensively playtested over several years, so they're not just random additions. They've been thought through thoroughly.
Summarizing every improvement and change concisely isn't really possible. The workshop page has a *slightly* more indepth list, but for a proper understanding I'd recommend actually playing it.


## Links
Due to the weird way this was set up (originally having been private) it is not set up as a fork of the original repository. So here's a link instead:

The gmod workshop page can be found here, and has a slightly more extensive description:
